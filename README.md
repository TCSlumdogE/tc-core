# Triple Confirmation â€“ Alpha v3

Triple Confirmation aims to revolutionise the crypto market by providing a non-custodial, automated trading platform built on Avalanche and other EVM-compatible blockchains. The trading strategies are designed to analyse market trends and execute trades on behalf of users, whilst smart contracts ensure that users always maintain control over their funds and can cancel or modify trades at any time. Unlike centralised exchanges, Triple Confirmation does not hold custody of user funds, and instead uses 0x for trade execution and AAVE for short positions, allowing for a decentralised movement of funds. Triple Confirmation strives to push forward the crypto industry's decentralisation and provide a secure and profitable automated trading experience for all crypto users.
