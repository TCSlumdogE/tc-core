# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/script-name-goes-here.js
npx hardhat help
```

REQUIREMENTS:
	npm install --save-dev hardhat
	npm install hardhat-contract-sizer
	npm install hardhat-abi-exporter
	npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers

Contracts are located in /contracts
ABIs are created on compile
